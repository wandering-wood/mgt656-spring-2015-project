          "By the conclusion of our last sprint, we essentially finished all of the story points that we had to complete. While we were happy with our progress and encouraged by the fact that we passed most of the tests, our site was quite ugly. We collectively agreed that the major focus of this sprint would be to improve the site aesthetics. Once we divided up the work (see method of point estimation paragraph), we agreed to all work separately and email one another when roadblocks arose, in a similar way to our previous sprint. We also agreed that each person was free to use his or her own discretion when deciding on what design looked the best. In this instance, we risked not making our site have a similar theme. During the same meeting, Cheng gave David, Stefan, and Nilofer a brief tutorial on how to change the formatting of a page in Cloud9 and used the AirBnB website as an example of how the CSS functions on that website.",
          "On Monday during class, we met one last time to ask each other what we thought of each page (ex: question regarding opinions about font size and color) and Cheng answered some lingering questions (such as helping Stefan commit his branch). During this time we discussed possible ways to improve our workflow, but didnâ€™t come up with any substantial ideas."

        [
          "As soon we decided that this sprint would be dedicated to improving the site aesthetics, we debated playing another game of planning poker to see how many points each formatting task would be. We quickly realized that we not only were unsure of how long each task would take, but that going into very granular detail about each task (Ie: font size for home page) would be overly cumbersome and too specific. Instead, we decided that since Nilofer, Stefan, and David had somewhat similar programming capabilities, each of them would try to work on the aesthetics of one particular page, and that improving each page would be about 25 points of work. Cheng, would continue to act as the scrum master, and answer any questions that arose throughout the sprint."

Cheng gave Dave, Stefan, and Nilofer a 30 minute tutorial at the beginning of the sprint and answered questions throughout the week. Overall, each person felt that the workload was adequate."
